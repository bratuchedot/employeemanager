# Employee Manager
## Simple Web App with a few functionalities.

- Add a new employee
- Edit an existing employee
- Delete an employee
- Filter employees

The application is created by using Spring Boot Framework for backend and Angular for frontend.
If you want to run it on your computer you need to have software tools listed down below pre-installed.

- [Java] - Java programming language
- [node.js] - JavaScript runtime environment
- [Angular] - Angular JavaScript front-end framework
- [IntelliJ IDEA] - Integrated development environment

Keep in mind first you need to run the database server and then the angular app. Both of them are using their default port (8080 java, 4200 angular).
